Hey there! <br>
PPNV Service in touch! :) <br>
We are a team of programmers with extensive experience in testing the Cosmos ecosystem blockchain POS networks. <br>
Our team has been participating in testnets for more than 2 years and we help projects from the very early start. <br>
We provide all the necessary services to help the community:

✔️ API/REST Endpoint <br>
✔️ RPC Endpoint <br>
✔️ gRPC Endpoint <br>
✔️ Web gRPC Endpoint <br>
✔️ Genesis files <br>
✔️ IBC Relayers <br>
✔️ Seed Node <br>
✔️ Live Peers <br>
✔️ Addrbook file <br>
✔️ State Sync <br>

Our team uses only high-quality, reliable and expensive servers around the world. <br>
We use various means to constantly monitor the status of our validators 24/7. <br>
Our team always completes all necessary network updates and voting on proposals on time. <br>

Many projects have already chosen us as main validators in mainnets. <br>
Today we serve more than 30 networks and the number is constantly growing. <br>

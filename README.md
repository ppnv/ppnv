Hey there! <br>
PPNV Service in touch! :) <br>
We are a team of programmers with extensive experience in testing the Cosmos ecosystem blockchain POS networks. <br>
Our team has been participating in testnets for more than 2 years and we help projects from the very early start. <br>
We provide all the necessary services to help the community:

✔️ API/REST Endpoint
✔️ RPC Endpoint
✔️ gRPC Endpoint
✔️ Web gRPC Endpoint
✔️ Genesis files
✔️ IBC Relayers
✔️ Seed Node
✔️ Live Peers
✔️ Addrbook file
✔️ State Sync

Our team uses only high-quality, reliable and expensive servers around the world. <br>
We use various means to constantly monitor the status of our validators 24/7. <br>
Our team always completes all necessary network updates and voting on proposals on time. <br>

Many projects have already chosen us as main validators in mainnets. <br>
Today we serve more than 30 networks and the number is constantly growing. <br>
